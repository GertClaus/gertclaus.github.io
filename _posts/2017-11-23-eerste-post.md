Aye. Who? Me brother. (surprised) Wait a minute...you have a brother named Martin McFly? (they stop walking) Had a brother. (Marty gets the "I-don't-need-this" expression on his face.) Martin used to let men provoke him into fighting. He was concerned people would think him a coward if he refused. That's how he got a bowie knife shoved through his belly in a saloon in Virginia City. Never considered the future, poor Martin, God rest his soul. (walks off)

Alright. (realizing they're in danger) No, Emmett. I'll dance with him. Boys, keep the blacksmith company while I get acquainted with the fil. (He pushes Doc aside and his gang members take a hold of each of his arms.) WOO...HA HA HA! YEAH. OOOH. I don't dance very well when my partner has a gun in his hand. Well, you'll learn. (to Doc) You know, Smithy, I may just take my $80 worth outta her. (Doc struggles to get free) WOO...HAHAHA! YEAH. (to Clara) I bet there's somethin' you can do that's worth $80.

Right here, Tannen! (Tannen turns and spots Marty. They assume positions seen in normal shooting scenes in Westerns. Everyone who was in the saloon comes out and so do all the townspeople near by.) Draw! No! (Tannen stares at him. He throws his gun and belt down, and gulps.) I thought we could settle this like men. (pause) You thought wrong, dude. (He shoots and Marty falls to the ground.)
